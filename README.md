# Machine-Learnig-from-Scratch
ML from Scratch is an educational project that implements core ML algorithms using pure Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level ML libraries such as scikit-learn.  goal of this repository is to deeply understand how machine learning algorithms work internally by building step by step from mathematical foundations to working code.
