# Machine-Learnig-from-Scratch
ML from Scratch is an educational project that implements core ML algorithms using pure Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level ML libraries such as scikit-learn.  goal of this repository is to deeply understand how machine learning algorithms work internally by building step by step from mathematical foundations to working code.

# Machine Learning from Scratch 🧠

This repository contains **Machine Learning algorithms built from scratch in Python** — without using high-level libraries like scikit-learn for implementation.  
The goal is to understand the **mathematics and code behind ML algorithms**, and build them manually to gain deep intuition.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repo includes implementations of classic ML models:

✔️ Linear Regression  
✔️ Logistic Regression  
✔️ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
✔️ Decision Trees  
✔️ Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each algorithm is implemented:
- with Python
- from first principles
- with step-by-step explanation
